# STOP-SaveTheOrphansPlease_Game

OCCC - Java (Programming 1 equivalent) <br />
Spring 2019 (Year 1 / Semester 2) <br />
Group Project (Team of 2)
 - The agenda is to create a game using OOP in Java within the Greenfoot environment.

### STOP is a platformer where you play as a nun.
 - Objective: Collect/save enough orphans before the timer runs out (before Godzilla reaches the left side of the screen).
 - Enemies: Avoid encountering the flashers (robed men) or else your health bar may empty, ending the game before the timer runs out.
